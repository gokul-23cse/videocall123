## 🆘 Something Wrong?

### "Connection refused"
→ Make sure server is running (`npm start`)

### "No camera showing"
→ Check browser permissions (Settings → Privacy)

### "No remote video"
→ Wait 5-10 seconds, check both users allowed permissions

### "Port 8080 in use"
→ Stop other Node processes and restart

### "Still stuck?"
→ Read [TESTING.md - Troubleshooting](TESTING.md#common-issues--solutions)
